# Build scripts for RNP CI containers

This repository contains docker scripts to build containers that support RNP CI.

## Naming

Scripts naming follows the pattern

[source]
-----
<operating system>-<version>.Dockerfile
-----

for example,
[source]

-----
debian-11-i386.Dockerfile
-----

Containers' tags follow the pattern

[source]
-----
ci-rnp-<operating system>-<version>
-----

for example,
[source]

-----
ci-rnp-debian-11-i386
-----

## Image specification

RNP CI normally uses system shipped versions of dependencies.
However, under two circumstances custom requirements need to be supported:

* some legacy environments provide only versions that are not supported by rnp
* sometimes RNP needs to be tested with versions that differ from provided by system packages

This repository created images that support two cases listed above

Currently built gpg versions are 2.2.43 for lts, and 2.4.5 for stable.

### Pre-installed versions of gnugp and json-c and botan libraries

### Helper script

All images include helper script placed at /opt/tools/tools.sh
This script supports the following actions

#### /opt/tools/tools.sh build_and_install_botan [<botan version selector>]

Builds and installs specified botan version. _botan version selector_ is any tag or branch that can be used by _git checkout_ 
Specified bitan version is installed to _/opt/botan/<botan version selector>_

There are two special cases. 
If _<botan version selector>_ is _'head'_ the script uses _'master'_ for checkout
If _<botan version selector>_ is omitted, the script build default botan version (2.18.2) and installs it to _/usr/local_

#### /opt/tools/tools.sh build_and_install_gpg [<gpg version selector>]

Builds and installs specified gpg version. _gpg version selector_ can be _head_, _stable_ or _lts_ only. 
Build is performed using the script from  _https://github.com/rnpgp/gpg-build-scripts_ and specification below
