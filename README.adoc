# Build scripts for RNP CI containers

This repository contains docker scripts to build containers that support RNP CI.

## Naming

Scripts naming follows the pattern

[source]
-----
<operating system>-<version>-<cpu family>.Dockerfile
-----

for example,
[source]

-----
debian-11-i386.Dockerfile
-----

Containers' tags follow the pattern

[source]
-----
ci-rnp-<operating system>-<version>-<cpu family>-<cc setting>
-----

for example,
[source]

-----
ci-rnp-debian-11-i386-clang
-----

## Applicability

RNP CI normally uses system shipped versions of dependencies.
However, under two circumstances custom requirements need to be supported:
* some legacy environments provide only versions that are not supported by rnp
* someties RNP needs to be tested with versions that differ from provided by ststem packages

This repository supports two cases listed above
